-------------------------------------
  NOTE : this is *alpha* software
  It will probably kill your system,
  murder your friends and bring 
  about the apocalypse. You have  
  been warned. So watch it.
-------------------------------------

Currently just install like any other Perl module :

% perl Build.PL
% perl Build test
% su
# perl Build install


During the install process you will be asked to provide a directory to
install the database in. /usr/local/siesta/ will probably be ok. The 
installation process doens't create directory for you so you may need to 
do that.

The first thing you'll need to do is create the database. 

Because of the way it will be run the user that runs the mail process 
will need read and write access to that directory and the database that 
goes in there. Make a new group called siesta or something and add the 
mail user (usually 'mail' or 'exim' or something), the webserver user 
(for when we have a web based interface, this is usually 'nobody') and, 
if you want to, either yourself or a new user expecially for 
configuring siesta ('siesta' is a good name for this). Then 

  % sudo nacho create-database

  % chgrp -R siesta /usr/local/siesta
  
  % chmod -R g+rwx /usr/local/siesta

or some combination of these. Basically you want to end up with an empty 
database with all the tables set up that is readable and writeable by 
your mail user and, optionally, the web server user and anybody else you 
want to have configuration rights for Siesta.

Then read the MANUAL file in the docs directory for how to create new 
lists and users, add users to lists, configure plugins and generally 
administer the system.

Then you'll need to create a list
 
  % nacho add-list newlist

When Siesta isn't alpha software this installation process will be a lot 
easier, we promise.
