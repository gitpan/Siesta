-------------------------------------
  NOTE : this is *alpha* software
  It will probably kill your system,
  murder your friends and bring 
  about the apocalypse. You have  
  been warned. So watch it.
-------------------------------------


-------------------------------------
 * Installing the modules
-------------------------------------

Currently just install like any other Perl module :

% perl Build.PL
% perl Build test
% su
# perl Build install


During the install process you will be asked to provide a directory to
install the database in. '/usr/local/siesta/' will probably be ok. 

From now on we'll assume that you've chosen '/usr/local/siesta' however
you should subsitute whatever you actually chose wherever this document 
mentions it.



-------------------------------------
 * Setting up the database
-------------------------------------

The first thing you'll need to do is create the database. 

Because of the way it will be run the user that runs the mail process 
will need read and write access to that directory and the database that 
goes in there. Make a new group called siesta or something and add the 
mail user (usually 'mail' or 'exim' or something), the webserver user 
(for when we have a web based interface, this is usually 'nobody') and, 
if you want to, either yourself or a new user expecially for 
configuring siesta ('siesta' is a good name for this). Then 

  % sudo nacho create-database

  % chgrp -R siesta /usr/local/siesta
  
  % chmod -R g+rwx /usr/local/siesta

or some combination of these. Basically you want to end up with an empty 
database with all the tables set up that is readable and writeable by 
your mail user and, optionally, the web server user and anybody else you 
want to have configuration rights for Siesta.

Then read the B<Siesta::UserGuide> file using 

  % perldoc Siesta::UserGuide

for how to create new lists and members, add members to lists, configure 
plugins and generally administer the system.

Then you'll need to create a list
 
  % nacho create-list <newlist>

When Siesta isn't alpha software this installation process will be a lot 
easier, we promise.



-------------------------------------
 * Installing the web frontend
-------------------------------------

You need to add a line like this to your Apache config in one of the 
virtual server sections

  ScriptAliasMatch /siesta/.*\.tt2 /usr/local/siesta/web-frontend/tt2.cgi

Then you need to copy the directory 

    /usr/local/siesta/web-frontend/siesta 

to the document root of the virtual server you've set the ScriptAlias for and 
away you go.

It should be noted that the web frontend currently looks like ass. Most of the 
functionality is there but work needs to be done on making it not completely 
braindead usability wise.
