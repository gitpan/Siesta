=head1 Stuff for pre-beta

=head2 configure/install

=head3 asking questions

perl Build.PL needs to grab more answers out of the existing
Siesta::Config and from the user to put into the new one (generated
from Config.pm.in)

=head3 listening to the answers

install the web-frontend somewhere (customise Siesta::Build)


=head2 sync MANIFEST

=head2 check dependencies are accurate



=head1 Post beta stuff

=head2 Web interface

=head3 setting prefs - constrained input based on type field


=head2 Integration with Mariachi

password-protected archives should be easy via the mod_perl handler


=head2 Plugin::NNTP

one side effect of moving from Mail::Internet is that the NNTP send
code will have to grow a few extra lines to invoke Net::NNTP directly.

This and the need for a nntp->siesta gateway[0] has made me split this
out into a seperate distribution.

=head2 List control

Only allow list.owner to modify a list - only Siesta::Web enforces this.

In future it may be an idea to allow multiple owners per list


=head2  Import utilities

Extend I<bandito> to also steal configs from ...
 
	* majordomo
	* ezmlm


=head2  Domo plugin - remote adminstration tasks

Do a plugin that emulates the Majordomo command set.

=head2 Digests

One plan is this:

=head2 Revisit bounce handling (VERP stuff)

Nicholas Clark wants to look at this


=head2 Archiving

Archive.pm should also embed optionally embed a url where the 
message is archived.


=head2 Better install

Maybe. This might just mean providing .debs/.rpms/ports etc etc


=head2 hook into Exim

Like wot Mailman does


=head2 tequila daemon

A long running tequila process
