All you motherfuckers are gonna pay, You are the ones who are the
ball-lickers.  We're gonna fuck your mothers while you watch and cry
like little bitches.  Once we get to Hollywood and find those Miramax
fucks who are making that movie, we're gonna make 'em eat our shit,
then shit out our shit, then eat their shit which is made up of our
shit that we made 'em eat.  Then you're all fucking next.

Love, Jay and Silent Bob.
